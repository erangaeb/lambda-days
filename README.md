Discussion on functional programming tips. Mainly with scala, sometimes erlang ;)

## TODO

Functional programming is NOT just writing functions :). Need to have a discussion on how to write better codes by 
using functional programming practises. Following are the topics that could be discussed.

1. Why functional 
2. Immutability
3. Recursion
4. Functional arguments
5. Anonymous functions
6. Function composition
7. Currying
etc..
